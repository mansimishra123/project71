        <h4>New school canteen</h4>
        <img src="canteen.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 environment_li" <p
          class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">My school is a very big one and it has a very
        modern canteen. It is perhaps the most popular place in the school. It becomes very busy during the break times
        very difficult to find a seat to sit on during those times, so we have to stand and eat.
        Our school canteen is very well equipped. One can buy almost every kind of snack there, like samosas, chips,
        sandwiches, sweet, cakes etc. They are prepared in very hygienic surroundings by our school cook, and tables to
        sit on and eat, and ovens to keep the food warm. There is also a soda fountain which is Very popular among the
        older students.

        All the students love to sit in the canteen and discuss the events of the day. The noise level is always very
        high in the canteen as everyone is shouting to make himself heard. There are notice boards and suggestion boxes
        which all students are freely. There is also a separate enclosure for teachers. The cook charges very reasonable
        rates from us.

        I think that the school canteen is my favorite place in the school. I always enjoy myself there, and look
        forward to the recess when I can rush to the canteen with my friends.</p>

      <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
      <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">In today's competitive world, with increasing
        working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech tools which help them manage precious class time
        efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with completing formal duties, for
        e.g. taking daily student attendance.

        Manually taking attendance and registering it in files & musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for
        the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time.

        To overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems available to speed up the
        attendance process and reduce manual work. An online attendance management system or digital attendance platform
        is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it helps to
        maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.</p>
